## What the heck is pechaflickr?

Huh? Give pechaflickr a tag to find flickr photos, how many you want, how long you want each slide on the screen, and see what kind of improv you and your friends can do.

And try the new *Heather mode* -- Inspired by the suggestion of a grade 6 teacher, in this mode the tag is not displayed, and the challenge is to guess the tag from the pictures you get.

## Requirements

You will need a web server or a local running server PHP and to get a flickr API key. Do I really need to say you need the internet?

## Setting Up

1. Copy all files to your web server in directory of your choice. 
2. Get a flickr api key http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/
3. Edit config.php to enter the string for the API key
4. Play and have fun
